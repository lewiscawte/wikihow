				The simplest and most effective way to peel a banana is by use of the convenient "handle" on one end of the fruit.  However, individuals unpracticed at peeling bananas or those with insufficient wrist strength may find that this conventional method "mushes up" the top of the banana.

				Want the perfect blow dry?In a world of  early mornings, late nights, endless last minute jobs and frantic hurrying, the 'towel off and run' gig doesn't seem to cut it anymore. Sure, every hairdresser vows that constant blow drying will damage your locks. But how, exactly, are you supposed to stroll into your office job wearing a suit - with dripping wet hair? How do you make it to that party without ratty wet ringlets? Air drying may be healthy and natural, but blow drying, when done carefully and with the right techniques, can not only keep your locks dry, but also improve them, without excess damage. So if you're sick of wet patches on the back of your shirt and frantically rubbing your wet "do" with a towel, then ditch your old routine and improve your blow drying techniques today.

    		<video:description><![CDATA[
				An aerial cartwheel is one of the first airborne skills gymnasts such as these learn.
An aerial cartwheel is basically a cartwheel without hands. Aerial cartwheels  can be quite frustrating when it takes a while to get. Sure, you can try different take-off techniques (i.e. off a springboard or off a panel mat), and often those can be enough to teach a gymnast the essential detail of what makes a successful aerial cartwheel. But other times, -- and this is true with most skills, especially with younger gymnasts -- repetition just becomes "busy work" and they don't try to understand how the skill works.

    		<video:title>How to Comfort Someone Who Is Sad</video:title>
    		<video:description><![CDATA[
				There are so many people that for one reason or the other, are sad, alone, and spend many nights in their homes, behind locked doors, and in need of comfort.  We walk the streets and might meet a homeless person, his only bed a piece of cardboard, spread out on the hard concrete. He might have lost his family, or lost his home, or his job, and yet we walk by ignoring him, instead of attempting to comfort him. There are just as many sad people, as there are happy people, and yet, we tend to ignore the sad, and team up with the happy.
