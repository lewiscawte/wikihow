We've missed you. We noticed that you haven't edited on wikiHow in 30 days. Unfortunately, to keep our docents lists up to date, we will need to remove your name from the list of category docents. You can continue be listed as a category docent, by making 5 edits on wikiHow in the next 7 days.

Category docents on wikiHow are volunteers who make sure the categories are well maintained. (More info: $3 ). You are currently listed as a docent of the following categories:

Again, to remain listed as a category docent, just make 5 edits on wikiHow within the next 7 days.

Thank you for your past contributions to wikiHow. Your volunteer efforts here have helped us create a how-to manual which has offered a free practical education to millions of people.

Unfortunately, we haven't seen you editing at wikiHow in over 45 days. As a result, we have removed your name from the list of active category docents. (See $3 for information about the docent program.)

We would gladly welcome you back to wikiHow as an editor or docent. Please return to wikiHow ( http://www.wikiHow.com ) and start a new article or edit any other page on the site. If you want to rejoin the category docents, simply sign up again for the docents. Again, your past contributions here are greatly appreciated by our editing community and by the millions of people who read wikiHow. We hope you return to wikiHow and edit again.

Best,
