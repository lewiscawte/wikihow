#  [[Image:Stripper photo.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Don't worry, you don't need to know pole tricks]]Before you even consider auditioning at a strip club, make sure you are toned. There is a lot of girls who think you must be "perfect" to work in a strip club. This is not the case. You do not need to be perfect or anywhere near. You do however need to be toned. Most clubs will accept girls who have cellulite and stretch marks. So hopefully this puts your mind at ease. If you are unsure of your body, diet and exercise in a healthy way to get the figure you need. It is possible for almost anyone to have a body like the girls who work in strip clubs.
#  Phone local clubs you are planning to work for. Ask them what their audition process is like and what you should wear including the type of underwear.
#  Be prepared. Most clubs have an audition process where you turn up and dance on stage to song/songs and remove your clothes while the club is closed. If you do not know how to pole dance, don't worry, most girls don't know how to pole dance when they first start. Just sway and move sexily to the music using the pole to turn around and support you. Some clubs will want you to choose the music you want to dance to. Plan for this and choose songs which allow you to move sensually. A good genre of music to dance sexy to is urban music. Do not pick something too rock and roll or non sexy. It will be hard for you to get into the "role" of the sexy dancer and move seductively.
# Check out Amateur Night. Other clubs have auditions where they hold "amateur nights". This is a night where girls who want to be hired turn up and dance on the stage while the club is open and has customers there. They then are judged depending on how the audience reacted. Some even have competitions where you have to "win" a place to work in their club.
# Dress for the job you want. Other clubs just ask you to turn up and eyeball you in your street clothes and tell you immediately if you are hired. If this is the process for the club you are going to, wear clothes which show the shape of your body. Something like skinny jeans and a tight top would be fine.
#  Prepare what you will wear to your audition. When you call the club to ask about their audition process, make sure you also ask them the dress code. Some clubs are strictly gown clubs and others are bikini clubs. So make sure you buy and wear the appropriate clothes.
#  Buy some good stripper shoes. You can get them online or at local adult shops. Make sure they are at least 3 inches high and that you feel comfortable in them.

== Tips ==
*If you need to lose weight to work in a strip Club, then do it in a healthy way.  Quick weight loss will not give you the body you need for a stripper as you will end up with a lot of slack skin. A reasonable rate of weight loss is about 2-3 lbs a week. Control the junk food you eat and do cardio exercise (running, swimming etc) and some weights to tone the body. You do not need to rush your weight loss as it is also very unhealthy.
*Before deciding on audition at a  club, it is a really good idea to visit the club you want to go to with a friend to see if you feel safe and like it there.
*When you do an audition and you have to dance on the stage, it is a good idea to go to pole dancing classes, as it will make you feel more confident. 2-3 lessons will be more then enough.
*If you do not know what you are doing, then do NOT do any pole dancing tricks. It will look more unattractive if you fall.
*You can get some really good stripper clothes online and from eBay.

== Warnings ==
*Do not audition at a club if you feel that it is unsafe.  Go with a friend if it is closed and make sure people know where you are.
*Do not talk to other girls at the club when you get there. Some girls may put you off as they see you as competition
*Make sure you get used to dancing in your new shoes as you may fall if you do not get used to them
*Do not wear any moisturizing cream or oil as the pole will get slippery and will firstly give you less support and also may cause an accident for the next girl after you.
