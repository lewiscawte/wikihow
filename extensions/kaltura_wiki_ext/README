Below are the instructions for installing Kaltura's MediaWiki Video Extension.
(These instructions and additional information can also be found at: http://www.kaltura.com/wiki/index.php/MediaWiki_Extension)
Note that this extension can be used with MediaWiki version 1.10 and up.

If you are installing this extension for the first time:

1. Extract the zipped file under the wiki/extensions directory.
   It will create a directory called kaltura_wiki_ext which will include 20 files of types 'php' 'js' and 'css' and a directory named 'log' (which includes a single file) and a directory named 'images'

2. In the wiki's main directory, edit LocalSettings.php, and under the line saying
  require_once( "$IP/includes/DefaultSettings.php" );
  Or
  require_once( "includes/DefaultSettings.php" );

  paste the following:
  require_once( "$IP/extensions/kaltura_wiki_ext/kaltura_extension.php" );

3. Log into the wiki as an admin.  
Now refresh the wiki and go to Special Pages – you will see a new special page named: 
"Video extension installation".  Click on the new page and follow the instructions to complete installation

4. Following the installation, we recommend that you enable logging, in order to monitor and track any issues. To enable logging:
      * Set $log_kaltura_services = true;
      * Grant write permissions to the '../kaltura_wiki_ext/log' directory in order to
	allow the extension to log debug info into a file called 'kaltura_extension_log' 

5. Feel free to contact Kaltura at support@kaltura.com with any question you have.


If you are updating your existing Kaltura video extension /Already have a Kaltura Partner ID:

1. Under the wiki/extensions directory, rename the directory called kaltura_wiki_ext to be named kaltura_wiki_ext1
   This will ensure that your previous version is saved (in the rare case that it will need to be referenced in the future)
